I broadly classify my thesis journey as the following
sections. For each session I would briefly share my
experience and some important things I learned. I hope this
might be helpful for you.

1. [Searching for a topic and thesis
   supervisor](topic_supervisor.md)
2. [Writing the thesis](writing.md)
3. Building the empirical model
4. [Presentation](presentation.md)

My experience in building the empirical model is captured
in another GitHub repo.
