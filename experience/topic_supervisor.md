# Searching for a topic and supervisor

I think one of the most difficult challenges in writing
thesis is to find a topic that is interesting to you, your
supervisor and contributes to economic literature.
Firstly, an interesting topic keeps you engaged when the journey gets
tough.
Secondly, your supervisor might be selecting students based on
their own research field.
Lastly, the topic has to be somewhat of a research topic in order
to be 'qualified' as a thesis.

I started searching for a topic by understanding what I am
good at, and what I want to explore further. Machine
learning is something I have explored for a few years.
However, I wanted to take a break from machine learning
initially and explore something different.

Initially I was heavily drawn towards causal machine
learning. Causal machine learning uses machine
learning models for causal inference instead of traditional
linear models, which is taught in EC4305 Applied Econometrics.
Causal inference is a field I am interested in but have
little experience on, and I thought it would be a great area
to explore.

Having said that, I realized it is difficult
to find a suitable dataset to answer causal inference questions.
My supervisor recommended me to apply causal machine
learning techniques on an existing paper and show the
difference in performance between machine learning models and
linear models.
However, I was troubled that counterfactual data
cannot be observed, and I would not be able to quantitatively
justify which model is better. Therefore, I decided to go
back to machine learning models.

My supervisor encourages me to search up on the latest
machine learning researches in economics.
One of the paper caught my eye: Chen et al. (2021)'s deep
learning in asset pricing, and that paper inspired my thesis.

I think exploring the latest research in the field helps me
find topics that are both interesting and 'worthy'
researching on. However, generally the latest literature use
more complicated model for estimation. A majority of my
initial time was spent on building custom neural network
models in TensorFlow and testing the model architecture.

Besides finding a good topic, it is also important to find a
suitable supervisor.
I asked around for thesis supervisor recommendations and
many recommended my supervisor. Furthermore, I was enjoying
my time in one of his modules. Therefore, I think one
possible avenue to search for supervisors is from professors
who have taught you previously, especially those who taught
topic you are interested in. I would also advise
start searching for a supervisor a semester to a year early.
Securing a supervisor early means there more time to explore
a suitable topic.

The topic research I used during my first meeting with my
supervisor is available [here](topic_research.pdf)
