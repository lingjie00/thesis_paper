## No-arbitrage asset pricing model

- No-arbitrage asset pricing model assumes the existence of
  an asset independent, time-dependent SDF $M_{t+1}$ such
  that 
  \begin{align}
    E_t(M_{t+1}R^e_{t+1, i}) = 0
  \end{align}
- SDF can be expressed as an affine transformation of the tangency portfolio
  $F_{t+1}$ such that $M_{t+1} = a - bF_{t+1}$
- The tangency portfolio is constructed as a weighted
  portfolio of all assets, we assume the SDF weight $\omega$ is a
  function of firm characteristics data $I_{t, i}$ and
  macroeconomic data $I_t$ such that
  $F_{t+1} = \omega(I_t, I_{t, i})^TR^e_{t+1}$
- Without loss of generality, consider $(a, b) = (1, 1)$, then
  the no-arbitrage asset pricing model can be expressed as
  a function of the SDF weight $\omega$ such that
  \begin{align}
      E_t\left[\left(1-\omega(I_t, I_{t, i})^T R^e_{t+1}\right)R^e_{t+1, i}
        \right] = 0
  \end{align}

# Methodology
## No-arbitrage pricing loss

- However, if no-arbitrage pricing model alone is
  insufficient to explain the variations in asset returns,
  we can define an alternative conditional moments function $g(I_t, I_{t, i})$ 
  such that
  \begin{align}
    E_t(M_{t+1}R^e_{t+1, i} g(I_t, I_{t, i})) = 0
  \end{align}
  which motivates the **pricing loss** used in the GAN model
\begin{align}
    &L(\omega, g|I_t, I_{t, i}) \nonumber \\
    &=
    \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left\{
    E \left[ \left( 1 - \sum_{j=1}^N \omega(I_t, I_{t, j})
    R^e_{t+1, j} \right) R^e_{t+1, j}g(I_t, I_{t, i})
    \right] \right\}^2
\end{align}

# Methodology
## Feed-forward neural network model

![Feed-forward neural network](../src/feedforward){width=50%}

- Hidden unit: $Z_m = h(\alpha_{0m} + \mathbf{\alpha}^T_m\mathbf{X}), ~m
= 1, \cdots, M$
- Hidden layer: $\mathbf{Z} = (Z_1, Z_2, \cdots, Z_m)$
- Output unit: $y = \beta_{0} + \mathbf{\beta}^T \mathbf{Z}$

# Methodology
## GAN model

- Zero-sum game between two neural networks
  1. Discriminator: estimating $\omega(I_t, I_{t, i})$
  2. Generator: estimating $g(I_t, I_{t, i})$
- Objective: Nash-equilibrium
  - Best discriminator that estimates the SDF
  - Best generator that constructs portfolio and factors
    that no-arbitrage pricing theory least able to explain
  - Evaluation through no-arbitrage pricing loss function

$$
\min_{\omega} \max_{g} L(\omega, g|I_t, I_{t, i})
$$

# Methodology
## GAN model training

![GAN model structure](../src/model){width=70%}

- Discriminator ($\omega$) estimates SDF weight
- Generator ($g$) estimates the conditional factors
- Finding the Nash Equilibrium through $\min_{\omega} \max_{g} L(\omega, g|I_t, I_{t, i})$

# Methodology
## Benchmark four-factor model

- Four-factor model
  1. $R^e_{mt}$ (market risk): excess return of market
     portfolio
  2. SMB (small minus big): outperformance of small market
     capitalisation companies relative to large market
     capitalisation companies
  3. HML (high minus low): the outperformance of high
     book-to-market value companies versus low
     book-to-market value companies
  4. UMD (momentum): accounts for the speed of price
     change
- Estimated through OLS
    - $E(\alpha_i) = 0, E(\epsilon_{t, i}) = 0$
    \begin{align}
    R^e_{t+1, i} = \alpha_i + \beta_i R^e_{mt} + s_i SMB_t + h_i
    HML_t + \omega_i UMD_t + \epsilon_{t, i}
    \end{align}
