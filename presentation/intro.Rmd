## Goal

- Examine the external validity of @chen_deep_2021's
  GAN model using the United Kingdom (U.K.) London Stock
  Exchange (LSE) data
- Why the UK market? Avoid "home bias": @karolyi_home_2012 found
  only 20% of the papers in top finance journals
  investigated countries outside of the United States

## Results
  1. GAN model outperformed benchmark four-factor model in
     terms of the Sharpe ratio
  2. Macroeconomic data is important in the SDF estimation
  3. Extended FF factors are the most important covariates
     in SDF estimation
  4. Extended FF factors are nearly linear in the SDF.
     However, there are interaction effects between the factors
