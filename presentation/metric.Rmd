## Sharpe ratio

- Proposed by @sharpe_mutual_1966 to evaluate performance of
  risk-adjusted assets relative to a risk-free asset
- Balanced excess return ($R_i - R^f$) and the risk of return,
  measured by the standard deviation of the returns $\sigma_i$
- **Higher Sharpe ratio indicates a better performing
  portfolio**

\begin{align}
S(R_i) = \frac{E_t[R_i - R^f]}{\sigma_i}
\end{align}
