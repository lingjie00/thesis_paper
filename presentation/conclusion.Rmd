## Research objective

  Examine the external validity of @chen_deep_2021's
  GAN model using the UK LSE 1998 - 2017 data

## Results
1. GAN model outperformed benchmark four-factor model in
   terms of Sharpe ratio
2. Macroeconomic data is important in the SDF estimation
3. Extended FF factors are the most
   important covariates in SDF estimation
4. Extended FF factors are nearly linear in the SDF.
   However, there are interaction effects between factors
