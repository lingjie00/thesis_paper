## Research objective

  Examine the external validity of @chen_deep_2021's
  GAN model using the UK LSE 1998 - 2017 data

## Results
1. GAN model outperformed benchmark four-factor model in
   terms of Sharpe ratio
2. Macroeconomic data is important in the SDF estimation
3. Factors in the factor model are the most
   important covariates in SDF estimation
4. Factors in factor model are nearly linear in the SDF.
   However, there is interaction effects between factors
