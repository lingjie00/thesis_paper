## Asset Pricing

One important goal in asset pricing

- How do we explain the variation in asset returns?

No-arbitrage pricing theory

- Assets are priced through the stochastic discount
  factor

  (SDF, also known as pricing kernel)

However, how do we estimate the SDF?

1. Choose the right factors (data features)
1. Select the right portfolio (combination of
   individual assets)
1. Estimate the functional form
