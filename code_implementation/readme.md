# Code implementation

In this folder we will include all the Python code implementation for our model training.

We used Python 3.8.10 during development.

Please install all the required libraries with

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Demonstration

We illustrated different functions for GAN model in [this notebook](GAN_demo.ipynb)

# Models

Models folder contains all the model implementation.

We separate the project into the following structure

1. Models
2. Loss
3. Training
4. Data

The script [main.py](model/main.py) will conduct the training.
