# Undergraduate thesis for economic study

This repo contains the writings and slides used for my
undergraduate thesis title
<Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model in Asset Pricing>.
If you are interested in my thesis, I would be more than
happy to have a discussion about it.

Having said that, the main purpose of setting up this repo
is for juniors who are writing thesis (especially economic
majors) but are unsure of how to start the whole process.
I would be sharing my journey and leave the raw files here
as an example of how I structured my thesis.

I classify my thesis journey as the following sections

1. Searching for a topic and thesis supervisor
2. Writing the thesis
3. Building the empirical model
4. Presentation

The most important file I think might be interesting for
readers is my [thesis
template](template/thesis_template.tex).
This template file is what I created to match the
requirement set by NUS Economic department.
The template is written in LaTeX, but I used it in R
Markdown files.
If you are interested in how I use the template, please
refer to my [main report file](report/thesis.Rmd)

If you are interested in my journey please refer to my
[experience sharing](experience/README.md)
