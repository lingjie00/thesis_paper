abstract: 
    "
    The critical goal in asset pricing is to understand the
    differences in asset’s average returns. No-arbitrage
    pricing theory provides a direct explanation by
    explaining price differences through an asset-pricing
    kernel. However, it remains a challenge to estimate the
    asset-pricing kernel. The difficulties include (1)
    choosing the right factors, (2) estimating the pricing
    kernel’s functional form, and (3) selecting the right
    portfolio to estimate the kernel. A recent paper
    proposed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model
    that attempts to solve all three challenges in a single
    setup and claim to achieve the best performance compared
    to all existing models [@chen_deep_2019]. This paper empirically
    validated Chen et al. (2019)’s research based on the United
    States stock data with the United Kingdom (UK) London
    Stock Exchange 2011 - 2021 data.

<!-- Results
We found the model performance to be
consistent in the UK 2011 - 2021 data,
outperforming Fama French model in explaining
the asset mispricing. -->
