abstract: 
    "
    An important topic in asset pricing is explaining
    the variation in expected returns of financial assets.
    No-arbitrage pricing theory suggests the idea of a
    pricing kernel that governs asset prices.
    However, it remains a challenge to estimate the
    asset-pricing kernel. The difficulties include (1)
    choosing the right factors, (2) estimating the pricing
    kernelâ€™s functional form, and (3) selecting the right
    portfolio to estimate the kernel.
    Recently, @chen_deep_2021 proposed a Generative
    Adversarial Network (GAN) model that attempts to solve
    all three challenges in a single setup and claim to
    achieve the best performance compared to all existing
    models.
    This paper seeks to empirically validate @chen_deep_2021's
    research based on the United States stock data
    with the United Kingdom (UK) London Stock Exchange 
    1998 - 2017 data.
    This paper found that the GAN model outperformed
    the benchmark four-factor model in terms of Sharpe ratio.
