abstract: 
    "The critical goal in asset pricing is to
    understand the differences in asset's average
    returns. Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
    provides a unified explanation through an asset
    pricing kernel. The challenges in estimating the
    asset-pricing kernel include choosing the right
    factors, estimating the pricing kernel's
    functional form, and selecting the right
    portfolio. A recent paper proposed a Generative
    Adversarial Network (GAN) model attempts to
    solve all three challenges in a single setup and
    claim to achieve the best performance compared
    to all existing models (Chen et al., 2019). We
    validated Chen's research and empirically tested
    the model performance in the United Kingdom (UK)
    data. We found the model performance to be
    consistent in the UK 19xx - 20xx data,
    outperforming Fama French model in explaining
    the asset mispricing."
