abstract: 
    "The critical goal in asset pricing is to
    understand the differences in asset's average
    returns. Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
    provides a unified explanation through an asset
    pricing kernel. The challenges in estimating the
    asset-pricing kernel include choosing the right
    factors, estimating the pricing kernel's
    functional form, and selecting the right
    portfolio. A recent paper proposed a Generative
    Adversarial Network (GAN) model attempts to
    solve all three challenges in a single setup and
    claim to achieve the best performance compared
    to all existing models [@chen_deep_2019]. We
    validated Chen's research and empirically tested
    the model performance with the United Kingdom (UK)
    data. We found the model performance to be
    consistent in the UK 19xx - 20xx data,
    outperforming Fama French model in explaining
    the asset mispricing."
