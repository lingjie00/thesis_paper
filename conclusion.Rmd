<!-- # Conclusion -->

This paper aims to empirically validate @chen_deep_2019's
model, which is trained on the US data with UK data.
Unlike the US, UK data is limited and is difficult to
access. This paper maximises the available data and
validates the model in different data available to show the
varying results when using simple factor models and the
flexible GAN model. This paper has shown that GAN
outperforms the four-factor model in terms of Sharpe ratio
if additional characteristics data is available.
Furthermore, agreeing with @chen_deep_2019, macroeconomic
data increases the Sharpe ratio. 
If no additional firm characteristics data is available, the
simple four-factor model outperforms the GAN model.
