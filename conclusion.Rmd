<!-- # Conclusion -->

In conclusion, this paper has derived four findings.
Firstly, this paper found that @chen_deep_2019's GAN model
is applicable to the U.K. market, where the model outperform the
benchmark of four-factor model in terms of Sharpe ratio.
The Sharpe ratio of the GAN models trained on all datasets
is higher than the four-factor model, except the GAN
model trained only on past return data.
Secondly, similar to @chen_deep_2019's finding,
macroeconomic data is essential in estimating SDF functional
form.
By including macroeconomic data in the GAN model, it results in a
higher Sharpe ratio than GAN models estimated without
macroeconomic data. Furthermore, the best performing GAN model requires
macroeconomic data.
Lastly, the U.K. SDF functional form has been consistent across
the years.
The Sharpe ratio in the training period is comparable to the
out-of-sample test period, suggesting that the SDF
functional form seems to be consistent over time. 
Having said that, the consistency applies to the period
explored in this paper. It is uncertain if the SDF will remain
consistent after Brexit and COVID-19.
With reference to the U.K. LSE 1998 - 2017 data,
this paper concludes that considering the GAN model does provide
a value to the asset pricing theory.
