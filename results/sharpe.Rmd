## Sharpe ratio

Similar to to @chen_deep_2019's finding, GAN SDF has a
higher out-of-sample Sharpe ratio compared to Fama French
models. In contrast to @chen_deep_2019's result where 
Sharpe ratio decreases over training and testing set, the
performance in UK data is consistent over different time
periods. This suggests that pricing kernel is likely to
remain consistent in UK over time. Table \@ref(tab:sharpe)
summaries the Sharpe ratio for different models.
