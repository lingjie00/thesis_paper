## Sharpe ratio

GAN models generally achieve a higher out-of-sample Sharpe
ratio than the four-factor model. The GAN model trained on
factor and macroeconomic data has achieved the highest Sharpe
ratio of 1.99 in the test period compared to 0.42 in
the four-factor model.
However, the GAN model trained solely on factor data has achieved a
Sharpe ratio of 0.33, which was lower than the four-factor model. 
Meanwhile, the GAN models trained on fundamental data achieve a higher
out-of-sample Sharpe ratio at 0.49 (without macroeconomic
data) and 0.69 (with macroeconomic data) than the
four-factor models.
Therefore, the overall trend in the results shows that the GAN models
outperform the four-factor model, which is consistent with
@chen_deep_2019's finding.

Additionally, this paper finds that adding macroeconomic data
can improve the GAN models in both datasets. The Sharpe ratio of 
GAN models trained on macroeconomic factors outperformed the
GAN models trained on the same dataset, without
macroeconomic data. The improvement in
model performance suggests that macroeconomic data
has a role in estimating the SDF, which aligns with
@chen_deep_2019's finding.

However, the Sharpe ratio is lower than the GAN model
trained without the additional fundamental data. 
Although fundamental data was relevant in @chen_deep_2019's
paper, the GAN models trained with income
statement data does not outperform those trained without
income statement data in this paper.
The two possible reasons for the lower performance could be
either the irrelevance of income statement data or the smaller
dataset in fundamental data.
In our results, the GAN model trained solely on fundamental data
outperformed the GAN model trained solely on factor
data. Therefore, this paper suggests that the lower
performance could be due to the smaller dataset. 
As mentioned earlier, fundamental training contains 242 stocks, while factor
training contains 942 stocks. Since all GAN models have the
same parameter setting, there could be insufficient data for
GAN models trained with fundamental data, and income
statements could still be relevant in estimating SDF.

In contrast to @chen_deep_2019's result, the Sharpe ratios
in this paper do not decrease sharply from the in-sample
period to the out-of-sample period. The GAN models are
trained based on 1998-2009 data while evaluated against
2010-2013 data and the out-of-sample period is from 
2014 to 2017. 
The stable Sharpe ratio suggests that although we expect the
SDF functional form to be time-varying, the UK SDF
functional form might be relatively consistent across the 5
to 10 years period.
