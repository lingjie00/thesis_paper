## Sharpe ratio

Similar to @chen_deep_2019's finding, GAN SDF generally
has a higher out-of-sample Sharpe ratio than the
four-factor model. However, GAN SDF performs worse than
the four-factor model when only factor data is used. Although
@chen_deep_2019 and @freyberger_dissecting_2017 have shown
that SDF is most likely non-linear, a simpler linear model
outperformed a complicated GAN model when data is limited.
Having said that, when macroeconomic data is available, the GAN
model outperforms the factor model. This suggests that
macroeconomic data has a role in estimating SDF,
which is consistent with @chen_deep_2019's finding.
The puzzling effect comes in when estimating GAN models with
fundamental data. The performance of GAN models deteriorates
compared to simply using factor and past return data.
Although having more covariates does not necessarily imply a
better model performance, in @chen_deep_2019's paper, income
statement data are relevant.
One possibility for the mismatched model performance
could be the much lesser data this paper used for fundamental
data compared to factor data. Fundamental training contains
242 stocks, while factor training contains 942 stocks. It
remained an open question on if the income statement data is
relevant in estimating SDF.

In contrast to @chen_deep_2019's result, where 
the Sharpe ratio decreases sharply over training and testing set, the
Sharpe ratio in UK data is relatively consistent.
The consistent results suggest that although we expect 
risk premia and risk exposure to be time-varying, the
UK SDF functional form might be relatively consistent over
time. Nonetheless, the training and validation period could
still be over-fitting the data. Therefore, only the
out-of-sample test period data remain the most relevant in
evaluating different models.

In conclusion, this paper found that GAN models outperformed
the four-factor model when measured by the Sharpe ratio.
However, the four-factor model outperformed the GAN model if only
past returns data is available.
Table \@ref(tab:sharpe-result) summarises the Sharpe ratio
for different models.
