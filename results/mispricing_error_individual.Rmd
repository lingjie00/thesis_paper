### Individual assets

As explained in [Mispricing error with beta representation](#beta),
the assets' expected excess return relates to the SDF by a
risk factor $\beta$. The equation

$$
E_t[R^e_{t+1, i}] = \beta_{t, i}E_t[F_{t+1}]
$$

implies that higher risk exposure $\beta_{t, i}$ should have
higher expected returns. We sorted the stocks by the $\beta$
after regressing to the GAN SDF and plotted the average
excess return against the $\beta$.
