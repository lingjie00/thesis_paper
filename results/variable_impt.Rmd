## Variable importance

To better understand how each variable affects the SDF
weight, we computed sensitivity score following
@chen_deep_2021's paper. The sensitivity score measures the
change in SDF weight $\omega$ as a variable changes. Mathematically this
is the average absolute gradient expressed in the following
equation. We define $C$ as a normalising constant scaling
sensitivity scores between 0 and 1. A higher
sensitivity means the variable has a larger effect on the
SDF weight $\omega$ with 0 being not relevant to 1 being
most important variable.

$$
\text{Sensitivity}(x_j) = \frac{1}{C} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{t=1}^T
    \left|  \frac{\partial \omega(I_t, I_{t, i})}{\partial x_j} \right|.
$$

We focus our analysis here on our top performing model: GAN
trained on factor and macroeconomic data.
With reference to Figure \@ref(fig:vi), the top four most
important variables are the four factors in the factor
model. Suggesting the factors are indeed very crucial in
estimating SDF weight. Following the factors we have the two firm
specific past return data, suggesting firm specific
characteristics are important as well. For macroeconomic
data, we notice that the top ten macroeconomic data
contributed most to the SDF weight. The top ten
macroeconomic data are revolving around indexes affecting
consumers, business and the general stock markets. The top
ten macroeconomic data includes producer price indices (PPI) of
different UK domestic markets, Composite leading indicator (CLI),
Consumer and Business confidence index (CCI, BCI)
iShares MSCI United Kindom ETF (UK_focused_equity) which
tracks the mid and large size companies in UK market,
and Standard & Poor 500 (SP500).
Interestingly the UK SDF weight is also affected by the US
market, suggesting possible benefits when including more US
market data in future studies.
