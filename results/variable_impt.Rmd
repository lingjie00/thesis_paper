## Variable importance

To better understand how each variable affects the SDF
weight, we have computed sensitivity score following
@chen_deep_2021's paper. The sensitivity score measures the
change in SDF weight $\omega$ as a variable changes. Mathematically, this
is the average absolute gradient expressed in the following
equation. We define $C$ normalising constant scaling
sensitivity scores between 0 and 1. A higher
sensitivity means the variable has a larger effect on the
SDF weight $\omega$ with 0 being not relevant and 1 being
the most important variable.

$$
\text{Sensitivity}(x_j) = \frac{1}{C} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{t=1}^T
    \left|  \frac{\partial \omega(I_t, I_{t, i})}{\partial x_j} \right|.
$$

In this paper, we focus our analysis on the top performing model: the GAN
trained on factor and macroeconomic data.
With reference to Figure \@ref(fig:vi), the top four most
important variables are the four factors in the factor
model (RMRF, HML, UMD, SMB). This thus suggests that the
factors are indeed very crucial in estimating the SDF weight.
Following the factors, we have the two firm
specific past return data and this implies that the firm specific
characteristics are important as well. For macroeconomic
data, we notice that the top ten macroeconomic data
contributed the most to the SDF weight. The top ten
macroeconomic data revolve around indexes affecting
consumers, business and the general stock markets. The top
ten macroeconomic data include producer price indices (PPI) of
different UK domestic markets, Composite leading indicator (CLI),
Consumer and Business confidence index (CCI, BCI)
iShares MSCI United Kindom ETF (UK_focused_equity) which
tracks the mid and large size companies in UK market,
and Standard & Poor 500 (SP500).
Interestingly, the UK SDF weight is also affected by the US
market, suggesting the possible benefits of including more US
market data in future studies.
