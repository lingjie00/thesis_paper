## SDF structure

We also studied the SDF weight structure as a function of the
factors and discovered the same two observations in
@chen_deep_2021's paper.
Firstly, factors in the four factor model have a linear relationship
with the SDF weight. 
Secondly, there is an interaction
between these factors.
Figure \@ref(fig:structure) plots the different combinations
of factors in a matrix form. The order of row and columns
represents value factor (HML), market excess return (RMRF),
size factor (SMB), momentum (UMD). The figure is achieved by
keeping all other factors at the mean level while changing
one of the factors.
The diagonal entries
show the general relationship between the factors and the SDF
weight. Moreover, the off-diagonal entries illustrate the
interaction effects between factors.
The different coloured lines correspond to different values of the
respective factors.
Upon analysis, all factors at the diagonal entries have a near
linear relationship with the SDF weight. This explains why
linear factor models generally work well.
On the other hand, we observe a
non-trivial interaction effects between the factors at the
off-diagonal entries.
Therefore, non-linear models such as the GAN model which
takes into account in the interactions between the factors
are able to perform better than linear models.
