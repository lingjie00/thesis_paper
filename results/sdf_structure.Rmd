## SDF structure

We also study the SDF weight structure as a function of the
factors. We discover the same two factors in
@chen_deep_2021.
Firstly, factors have a linear relationship
with the SDF weight. 
Secondly, there is an interaction
between factors.
Figure \@ref(fig:structure) plots the different combinations
of factors in a matrix form. The order of row and columns
represents value factor (HML), market excess return (RMRF),
size factor (SMB), momentum (UMD). The figure is achieved by
keeping all other factors at the mean level while changing
the one fixed factor.
The diagonal entries
shows the general relationship between the factors and SDF
weights. The off-diagonal entries illustrates the
interaction effects by changing one factors while keeping
all other factors at the mean level.
Looking at the diagonal entries, all factors have a near
linear relationship with the SDF weight. Explaining why
linear factor models generally works well.
Looking at the off-diagonal entries, we observe a
non-trivial interaction effects between the factors.
Therefore, non-linear models such as GAN that is able to 
factor in the interactions between factors are able to
perform better than linear models.
