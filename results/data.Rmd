This paper extracts the January 1998 to December 2017 London
Stock Exchange (LSE) monthly stock prices from Yahoo! Finance.
The full data is then split into 12 years of training data
(1998 - 2009), 4 years of validation data (2010 - 2013) and
4 years of out-of-sample testing data (2014 - 2017).
The risk free rate used to calculate excess returns are
taken from @gregory_constructing_2011.
Besides the risk free rates, @gregory_constructing_2011 also
provides monthly factor data containing small minus big
(smb), high minus low (hml), momentum (umd) factors and
value weighted market portfolio returns.
In addition to the price data, this paper extracts 16
firm-specific characteristics data from financial data
provider Finage. All quarterly data is interpolated into
monthly data and level data are transformed using log
differences.

This paper keeps returns of the stock with all firm
characteristics available in a certain month.
The availability of fundamental data depends on Finage
database, which contains only a subset of data with
fundamental data.
To maximise the data available, we perform two different
trainings. First training is based only on Fama and French
factors and past returns. A total of 651 stocks are available.
Second training is adds on firm-specific characteristics
data, a total of 98 stocks are available.

A large macroeconomic dataset on United Kingdom is retrieved
from @coulombe_can_2021. The dataset contains 112 monthly
macroeconomic indicators and has been transformed by the
author to stationary time series. Detailed explanation on
the macroeconomic dataset can be found in @coulombe_can_2021
website.
