# Introduction

The fundamental problem of asset pricing is in understanding
the risk premium, or the differences in asset's average
returns. Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) suggests that an
asset is priced through an asset pricing kernel. Although
the theory is attractive, it is an empirical challenge to
estimate the asset pricing kernel.

There are three challenges in estimating the asset pricing
kernel.
Firstly, in choosing the right factors (data features) to
estimate the pricing kernel. 
Secondly, in estimating the functional form of the pricing
kernel. 
Lastly, in choosing the right portfolio (combination of
individual assets) to estimate the pricing kernel. 

A recent paper proposed a Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) model that attempts to solve all three problems in a
single setup (Chen et al., 2019).
GAN models consist of a discriminative neural network model
and a generative neural network model. The discriminative
and generative works like police and thief with contrasting
objectives linked with a single pricing error loss function.
The competition can be viewed as a zero-sum game with the
discriminative network attempts to model the pricing kernel,
improving the asset pricing model's explanatory power and
reducing the pricing error loss. And the generative network
attempts to choose portfolio and factors that is least
explained by the asset pricing model to increase the pricing
error loss.
The goal is to build a discriminative network model with the
best pricing kernel estimation and a generative network
model with the best portfolio and factor construction.
In contrast to previous research that only focus on firm
characteristics, Chen further includes macroeconomic data
using neural network long short-term memory (LSTM) proposed
commonly used in predictions with a time series structure.
The result is exciting, Chen claim to have outperformed all
previous models in terms of xxx, xxx, and xxx.

Our paper attempts to validate Chen's research using the
network model proposed in the paper and empirically test the
performance in the United Kingdom stock market data from xxx
to xxx. We further upgraded Chen's code base from the now
depreciated TensorFlow v1.0 to the latest TensorFlow v2.0.
