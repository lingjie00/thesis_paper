<!--INTRODUCTION-->

The critical goal in asset pricing is to explain the variation
in expected returns of financial assets.
Arbitrage pricing theory (APT) suggests the idea of a pricing
kernel, also known as the stochastic discount factor (SDF),
that governs asset prices.
The literature on determining the appropriate form of the
SDF has a long history and perhaps one of the most extensive
analyses in finance.
However, it remains a challenge to estimate the pricing
kernel. There are three challenges in estimating the
asset-pricing kernel:
(1) choosing the right factors (data features) to
estimate the pricing kernel,
(2) estimating the functional form of the pricing
kernel and,
(3) selecting the right portfolio (combination of
individual assets) to estimate the pricing kernel. 

Factor models such as @fama_common_1993's three-factor model
and @carhart_persistence_1997's four-factor model
constructed different factors based on empirical
findings and estimated pricing kernel through a linear
combination of these constructed factors. 
These factor models have been performing well empirically,
and are considered the benchmark for assets pricing models.
Besides exploring various new possible factors,
recent literature also attempts to estimate the pricing
kernel using non-linear and non-parametric models.
For example, @gu_empirical_2020 found that neural network models
outperform linear model in estimating the pricing kernel.
Furthermore, @gu_autoencoder_2019 also realised that imposing
economic theory onto machine learning models can
improve model performance further.

With reference to existing literature, @chen_deep_2019 proposed a
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model that imposes the
APT condition in the neural network model.
GAN models are a class of neural network frameworks which
consist of two competing network models in a zero-sum game.
A discriminative neural network attempts to price the asset
prices using APT, while a generative neural network attempts
to increase pricing error through different combinations of
assets and factors.
Through the simultaneous training, the discriminative
neural network estimates the functional form of
the pricing kernel while the
generative network constructs different portfolios
that APT is least able to explain, thus solving the three
problems in asset pricing theory in a single setup.
As compared to previous research that focused on firm
characteristics data, @chen_deep_2019 included
macroeconomic data using long short-term memory (LSTM), a
class of neural network architecture commonly used in
predictions with a time series structure. Their findings
have shown that the inclusion of macroeconomic data did
enhance the model performance.
Therefore, @chen_deep_2019 analyses have outperformed all
previous models in Sharpe ratio, explained variation and
pricing errors.

However, similar to most literature, @chen_deep_2019's
research focus solely on the United States (U.S.) market.
In fact, @karolyi_home_2012 pointed out that only few papers in top
finance journals have explored the model performance in
non-U.S. markets.
The lack of comparison of model performance on non-U.S.
markets thus drives this paper to empirically validate the
external validity of @chen_deep_2019's research with the
United Kingdom London Stock Exchange data from 2011 to 2021. 
This paper concludes that the GAN model outperformed
benchmark four-factor model when evaluated against the Sharpe
ratio.
