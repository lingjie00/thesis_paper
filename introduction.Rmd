<!--INTRODUCTION-->

The fundamental problem of asset pricing is to understand
the risk premium, or the differences in asset's average
returns. No-arbitrage asset pricing model suggests that an
asset is priced through a single asset pricing kernel.
Although the theory is attractive, it is an empirical
challenge to estimate the asset pricing kernel.
There are three challenges in estimating the asset pricing
kernel.
Firstly, in choosing the right factors (data features) to
estimate the pricing kernel. 
Secondly, in estimating the functional form of the pricing
kernel. 
Lastly, in choosing the right portfolio (combination of
individual assets) to estimate the pricing kernel. 

A recent paper proposed a Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) model that attempts to solve all three problems in a
single setup [@chen_deep_2019]. GAN models is a class of
neural network framework which consist of a discriminative neural
network model and a generative neural network model. The
discriminative and generative models works like police and thief
with contrasting objectives linked with a single pricing
error loss function. The competition can be viewed as a
zero-sum game with the discriminative network attempting to
model the pricing kernel, improving the no-arbitrage asset
pricing model's explanatory power and reducing the pricing
error loss. In contrast, the generative network attempts to choose
portfolio and factors that is least explained by the
no-arbitrage asset pricing model to increase the pricing
error loss. The goal is to simultaneously build a
discriminative network model with the best pricing kernel
estimation and a generative network model with the best
portfolio and factor construction. As compared to
previous research that only focus on firm
characteristics data, Chen et al. (2019) further include macroeconomic data
using long short-term memory (LSTM), a class of neural
network architecture that is commonly used in predictions
with a time series structure. The result is exciting, Chen et al. (2019)
claim to have outperformed all previous models in terms of
Sharpe ratio, explained variation and pricing errors.

This paper attempts to empirically test the external validity
of Chen et al. (2019)'s research which is based on the United States stock
data with the United Kingdom London Stock Exchange data from
2011 to 2021.
