<!--INTRODUCTION-->

The fundamental problem of asset pricing is understanding
the differences in asset average returns. The no-arbitrage
asset pricing model suggests a single asset pricing kernel
known as stochastic discount factor (SDF) that priced all
assets in the economy. However, it is an empirical challenge
to estimate the asset-pricing kernel. There are three
challenges in estimating the asset-pricing kernel:
(1) choosing the right factors (data features) to
estimate the pricing kernel,
(2) in estimating the functional form of the pricing
kernel,
(3) selecting the right portfolio (combination of
individual assets) to estimate the pricing kernel. 

A recent paper proposed a Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) model that attempts to solve all three problems in a
single setup [@chen_deep_2019].
GAN models are a class of neural network frameworks
consisting of a discriminative neural network model and a
generative neural network model.
The discriminative and generative models work like police
and thief
with contrasting objectives linked with a single pricing
error loss function. The competition is a
zero-sum game with the discriminative network attempting to
model the pricing kernel, improving the no-arbitrage asset
pricing model's explanatory power and reducing the pricing
error loss.
In contrast, the generative network chooses portfolio and
factors that the no-arbitrage asset pricing model least
explains to increase the pricing error loss.
The goal is to simultaneously build a
discriminative network model with the best pricing kernel
estimation and a generative network model with the best
portfolio and factor construction.
Compared to previous research that only focuses on firm
characteristics data, Chen et al. (2019) further include
macroeconomic data using long short-term memory (LSTM), a
class of neural network architecture commonly used in
predictions with a time series structure. Chen et al. (2019)
claim to have outperformed all previous models in Sharpe
ratio, explained variation and pricing errors.

This paper attempts to empirically test the external validity
of Chen et al. (2019)'s research which is based on the United States stock
data with the United Kingdom London Stock Exchange 2011 to
2021 data.
