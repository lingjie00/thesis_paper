The critical goal in asset pricing is to understand the
differences in asset's average returns. Capital Asset
Pricing Model (CAPM) provides a unified explanation through
an asset pricing kernel.
The challenges in estimating the asset-pricing kernel
include choosing the right factors, estimating the pricing
kernel's functional form, and selecting the right portfolio.
A recent paper proposed a Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) model attempts to solve all three challenges in a
single setup and claim to achieve the best performance
compared to all existing models (Chen et al., 2019).
We validated Chen's research and empirically tested the
model performance in the United Kingdom (UK) data.

we found the model performance to be consistent in the
UK 19xx - 20xx data, outperforming Fama French model in
explaining the asset mispricing.
