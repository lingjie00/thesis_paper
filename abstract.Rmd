The critical goal in asset pricing is to understand the
differences in asset's average returns. Capital Asset
Pricing Model (CAPM) provides a unified explanation through
an asset pricing kernel. The challenges in estimating the
asset-pricing kernel include choosing the right factors,
estimating the pricing kernel's functional form, and
selecting the right portfolio. A recent paper proposed a
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model that attempts to
solve all three challenges in a single setup and claim to
achieve the best performance compared to all existing models
(Chen et al., 2019). We attempt to validate Chen's research
using the network model proposed and data provided in the
paper and hopefully test the model in another candidate
country.
