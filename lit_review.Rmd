<!-- Explain the objective in asset pricing
The main goal in asset pricing is to understand
the right pricing for an asset given the risk
of the asset. -->

One fundamental idea of asset pricing is no
arbitrage condition. Where the excess return is
the risk-free return plus the risk adjusted asset
return. (...) stochastic discount factor.

The empirical problem boils down to estimating the
stochastic discount factor (SDF).

<!-- Explain the current strategy in asset pricing-->

The challenge in estimating SDF comes in
estimating the structure form of the SDF,
selecting the right factor to estimate the SDF and
constructing the right portfolio.

Popular ways to estimate the structure forms of
SDF revolve around linear models (using linear
regression), non-linear models (using ensemble and
boosting tree models, deep neural network). Linear
model generally works well. Although non-linear
methods improved the performance, the improvement
is marginal.

The current method to select relevant factor
involves selection based on domain expertise (3,
4, 5 factors) or automatic feature selection
methods (regularized linear regression such as
Lasso). The 5 factor models seem to perform well,
and the feature selected by Lasso is good too.

The portfolio construction is less well researched
and mainly based on domain expert selection.
Therefore, researches focus on estimating
functional form of SDF and selecting relevant
factors would typically keep the portfolio
constant by using portfolio provided by (famous
author).

<!-- Explain the limitation in asset pricing strategy -->

As a result, the current research generally focus on
solving only one of the problems at one time.
Researches that focus on estimating the functional
form of SDF generally keep the portfolio and
factor constant. While researches that focus on
selecting the factors might alter the functional
form estimation but still keep the portfolio
constant.

The current researches work generally well, but
there is still gaps in the current methods given
by the statistically significant alpha in the
asset pricing model.

<!-- Explain how GAN model contributes to the strategy -->

Generative advisory network (GAN) model proposed by
(researcher name) attempts to solve asset pricing
by simultaneously solve the structure model
estimation, factor selection and portfolio
construction in a single estimation.

GAN model is based on deep neural network,
proposed by Goodfellow. The main idea is to train
two competing networks with different objectives,
and link the two network with a common loss
function. One can think of GAN model as a min max
optimization problem.

One network is called discriminative network. This
corresponds to standard estimation such as SDF
functional form estimation.

Another the network is called generative network.
Generative network attempts to propose new
observations that are unable to be explained by the
discriminative network. This could be considered
as constructing a portfolio where asset pricing
model failed to explain the excess return.

Therefore, by training both discriminative network
and generative network simultaneously, we are able
to estimate the functional form of SDF with
discriminative network, select the factors and
combine stocks to form portfolio that is the least
able to explained by the asset pricing model.

The (researcher) has showed that GAN model
outperformed any of the current SDF estimation,
and is able to construct portfolio where current
asset pricing models failed to explain most of the
excess returns. 

<!-- Explain the current validation strategy -->

The (researcher) has validated his research based
on US stock market with (xx) years of return,
using (xx) number of factors. The final estimation
is (xx), which is (xx) much better than current
research.

<!-- Explain why the validation strategy is insufficient -->

We attempt to validate the (researcher)'s claim by
constructing the GAN model described in the
network and cross validate the result in the
United Kingdom.

Although the (researcher) has release their code
base and data, there is little documentation and
the library is outdated. Most of the research
model failed to deliver practical impact due to
lack of execution. Furthermore, external
validity of the GAN model has yet to be discussed
as far as our best knowledge.

<!-- Explain how we aim to improve the validation strategy -->

Therefore, our paper attempts to reconstruct the
model using the latest library, with proper
documentation for further researches and test the
GAN model constructed based on the United Kingdom
data.

<!-- Explain the work done in UK, and why is it insufficient -->

The United Kingdom was selected due to the
availability of data. Most of the current
financial research is done on the United States,
contributing to a home bias. There is only (xx)
researches done on the United Kingdom, and we hope
to provide some insights on not just the GAN
model, but general asset pricing strategy on the
United Kingdom.
