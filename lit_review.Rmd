The asset pricing model explains the differences in asset
returns and risk-free returns through a risk exposure to the
asset pricing kernel called the stochastic discount factor
(SDF). However, it remains an empirical challenge to
estimate the SDF. The challenge in estimating SDF comes in
three aspects. (1) Estimating the functional form of the
SDF, (2) selecting the correct factor and (3) selecting the
right assets for estimation (portfolio construction).

Various papers have explored different models in estimating
the functional form of the SDF. They ranged from the popular
linear factor models [@fama_common_1993] to different
non-linear machine learning models such as tree and neural
network models. A comparison of different machine learning
models shows that tree and neural network models marginally
outperform linear models, with the neural network as the
best performing model [@gu_empirical_2019]. Recent papers on
asset pricing models using another class of advanced neural
network models Autoencoder suggest including economic theory
in estimation dramatically improves the model performance
[@gu_autoencoder_2019]. Therefore, the Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) model proposed by Chen et al. (2019)
similarity attempts to improve the neural network model
performance further by including the no-arbitrage condition
in the model estimation.

Different papers have estimated their models based on
various factors. For example, Fama and French (1993, 2015,
2017) expanded their factor models from three to six
factors. There are many other papers exploring the
possibility of other factors. A recent paper systematically
reviewed a wide range of previously proposed factors and
found that most factors provide little additional values
than the five factor model [@feng_taming_2020]. However,
Chen et al. (2019) show that all factors considered
contributed to the GAN model. Furthermore, Chen et al.
(2019) shows macroeconomic data further improves the model
performance, aligned with another research paper
[@pelger_interpretable_2018]. This paper extracts the United
Kingdom’s macroeconomic data from Goulet Coulombe et al.
(2021) and firm fundamental data from financial data
provider Finage.

Typical test portfolios are based on firm characteristics
sorted assets (Fama & French, 1993). Papers in the field
generally choose test portfolios based on firm
characteristics sorted assets such as Fama French Size and
Book-to-Market portfolios or include all assets in the
estimation. The GAN model in this paper contains a
discriminative network that performs asset selection to
maximise the pricing error.

GAN models are first proposed for image recognition tasks
[@goodfellow_generative_2014] and continue to be heavily
used in image and video tasks [@s_generative_2021]. The GAN
model in this paper included a recurrent neural network with
long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture
[@hochreiter_long_1997]. LSTM is commonly used in sequence
data to capture dynamics in data, such as language-related
tasks [@houdt_review_2020]. This paper uses the GAN model to
estimate SDF and portfolio construction, while LSTM extracts
latent variables from macroeconomic data.

This paper tested the external validity of the Chen et al.
(2019) model based on United Kingdom London Stock Exchange
data. Most of the empirical papers are tested on the
data-rich United States data, with around 20% of the papers
in top Finance journals investigating countries outside the
U.S. [@karolyi_home_2012]. Therefore, the performance of Chen et
al. (2019)’s model in a different context, such as the U.K.,
remained to be answered and explored in this paper.

Currently, limited papers done on the U.K. asset pricing
have their limitations. They are either exploring a limited
number of stocks [@njaala_does_2015], focusing only on
linear factor models [@bhatnagar_capital_2012]
[@korajczyk_empirical_1989] or forecast asset pricing
without considering economic theories [@tobek_does_2018].
Therefore, one of the critical contributions of this paper
is to provide insights into the potential benefits that
exploring advanced models that can bring to the United
Kingdom.

Training neural network models is an empirical challenge,
regularisation techniques are commonly used in machine
learning to prevent over-fitting. Besides the dropout
[@srivastava_dropout_2014] techniques adopted by Chen et al.
(2019), this paper further includes early stopping rules
[@yao_early_2007], allowing automated training instead of
arbitrary training epochs. Understanding and explaining
neural network require the foundation of many various
fields, this paper referenced to Hands-On Machine Learning
with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow for the explanation.
