<!-- The asset pricing model explains the differences in asset
returns and risk-free returns through a risk exposure to the
asset pricing kernel called the stochastic discount factor
(SDF). However, it remains an empirical challenge to
estimate the SDF. The challenge in estimating SDF comes in
three aspects. (1) Estimating the functional form of the
SDF, (2) selecting the correct factor and (3) selecting the
right assets for estimation (portfolio construction).
-->

The literature on determining the appropriate form of the
SDF has a long history and perhaps is one of the largest
analysis in finance. The first asset-pricing model proposed by
@sharpe_capital_1964, @lintner_valuation_1965 and
@mossin_equilibrium_1966 in the 1960s was called
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
CAPM explains the variation in asset
returns with the assets' exposure to market risk.
The resultant regression coefficient in this single-factor
model is coined as “beta”, and investors continued to use
“beta” to describe the risk of assets.

@fama_common_1993 later proposed a three-factor model that
expands on the CAPM model by including size and value
factors.
@fama_common_1993 found that small market capitalisation
stocks and low-value stocks outperformed the market, and
including the size and value factors improves the
performance of the CAPM model.
The size factor is the difference in returns between the
smallest and largest stocks measured by market capitalisation.
On the other hand, the value factor is the difference in
returns between the cheapest and
most expensive stocks measured by price to book ratio.
@carhart_persistence_1997 built on the three-factor model
to include a momentum factor: the difference
in returns between the best and worst-performing stocks.
@fama_five-factor_2015 later expanded on the three-factor model to
include profitability and investment. The profitability
factor is the difference in returns between stocks with high
and low operating profitability, and the investment factor is
the difference in returns between high and low capital
investment stocks. The three, four, and five factor models
have been a benchmark for asset pricing models and
remain relevant today. 
In recent years different research papers have attempted to
find new factors to improve the factor model performance.
The term "factor zoo" was used by @feng_taming_2020 to
describe the hundreds of factors proposed by different
literature.
@feng_taming_2020 and @freyberger_dissecting_2017
investigated the wide-ranging factors proposed by the
different literature and found only a handful is
statistically significant in explaining the asset returns.
The factor models fall under the arbitrage pricing theory
(APT) suggested by @roll_arbitrage_1984. APT summarises the
relationship between assets' expected returns and multiple
factors using a stochastic discount factor (SDF).

The factor models mentioned earlier explore different
factors while assuming a linear functional form for SDF.
Recent literature attempt to estimate SDF
with non-linear, non-parametric models such as tree and
neural network models. Non-parametric models do not require
a priori of the SDF functional form, while
non-linear models allow for a flexible estimation of the
SDF functional form. @freyberger_dissecting_2017 show that
non-linear relationships are essential in SDF estimation.
@gu_empirical_2019 compared different
machine learning models and show that tree and neural
network models marginally outperform linear models,
with the neural network model as the best performing model.

Traditional machine learning models do not 
consider economic theories during estimation.
@gu_autoencoder_2019 found that imposing
constraints based on economic theory can further improve
the neural network models.
Furthermore, @chen_deep_2019 imposed a no-arbitrage condition on neural
networks through a generative adversarial network (GAN)
model.

@goodfellow_generative_2014 first introduced GAN models for image recognition tasks,
and GAN models continue to be heavily used in image and video tasks,
as suggested by @s_generative_2021's recent survey.
GAN models differ from classical neural network models by including two
competing neural networks in a zero-sum game. In the context
of @chen_deep_2019 and this paper, one of the neural
networks will price assets through APT while the
other neural networks will attempt to find factors and
mispriced assets to increase pricing error.
This paper will explain the GAN model in detail under methodology.

Consumption-based asset pricing is another school of thought
that derives SDF directly from a utility function. However, 
@campbell_explaining_2000 show that the consumption-based model
cannot account for the time-varying
nature of SDF, resulting in poor performance compared to APT
models. Therefore, this paper continued to focus on APT
models.

Current literature estimates SDF solely based on the
firm characteristics data. However, 
@pelger_interpretable_2018 found that
including macroeconomic data can further improve the
performance of machine learning models, which is also
evident in @chen_deep_2019's results.
Therefore, @chen_deep_2019 included a recurrent neural network with
long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture in the GAN model
to capture the times series macroeconomic data.
@hochreiter_long_1997 first proposed the LSTM architecture, and a recent
review on the applications of LSTM by @houdt_review_2020
found that LSTM is still commonly used in sequence data to
capture dynamics in data, such as language-related tasks.
This paper will also explain the different LSTM components under
methodology.

The main contribution of this paper is in examining the
external validity of @chen_deep_2019's model with the
United Kingdom (U.K.) London Stock Exchange (LSE) data.
@karolyi_home_2012 found that most
empirical papers consider the data-rich United States, with
only around 20% of the papers in top finance journals
investigating countries outside the United States (U.S.).
Likewise, @chen_deep_2019 model was also
trained based on the U.S. data.
Therefore, this paper explores the model performance in a
different context, such as the U.K. market.
There are several works of literature done on LSE data,
but none answers the question this paper seeks to address.
@bhatnagar_capital_2012 and 
@korajczyk_empirical_1989 focus only on
linear factor models, while @tobek_does_2018
forecast asset prices without considering economic theories.
Therefore, one of the critical contributions of this paper
is to provide insights into the potential benefits advanced
models can bring to the United Kingdom.

<!--
Current literature recommended validating asset-pricing
models with portfolios instead of individual assets.
A portfolio combines multiple assets and could
theoretically reduce idiosyncratic volatility, improving
model estimation.
@fama_common_1993 proposed to form a test portfolio
by sorting assets based on firm characteristics, which
corresponds to the factors in the three-factor model.
Characteristics sorted test portfolios remain a popular
choice among literature.
This paper explores characteristics sorted portfolio
and individual assets to investigate the GAN model performance
in different contexts.
