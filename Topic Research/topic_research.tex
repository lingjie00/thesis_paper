    \subsection{Questions on writing thesis paper}

    How in-depth should an undergraduate thesis be? $\rightarrow$ what is the expectation?
    I saw some thesis simply compare off the shelve ML models without hyper-parameter tuning.

\section{Possible topics}

    \subsection{ML + Causal inference}

    \textbf{Motivation:} I think social sciences' unique selling point is in its causal inference study. The ability and
    focus on causal relationship instead of correlation sets a social scientist apart from computer scientist. \\
    Personally, I hope to further research on applying ML and other techniques to estimate heterogeneous causal effects. \\
    However, I have no experience in causal inference and I'm uncertain about how 'impactful' a causal paper might be,
    given that there is no ground truth on counter factual in the real world to compare with. \\
    Having said that, research on causal inference is of my top interest now.

    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{ML + Causal inference + Optimization}

    \textbf{Motivation:} This topic will be an extension of ML + Causal inference. In a business use case, usually the
    causal effect is not the final variable of interest. Business usually wants to maximise profit and/or minimise cost.
    Therefore, the causal effect is used to construct the optimization model which represents profit/cost function. \\
    However, currently business use correlation study to construct the optimization model instead of causation. It would
    be interesting to establish a framework from causal inference to optimization.

            $\rightarrow$ 'Understand how use ML tools in real world business problems, where causation matters more
            that correlation'
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{ML + Forecasting}

    \textbf{Motivation:} This will be most classic use case for Machine Learning $\rightarrow$ prediction based problem.
    We can apply different ML techniques to improve the economic forecasting ability. \\
    Furthermore, it will be the easiest to write about given the current maturity in data science field 
    and most of my internship experience is prediction based. \\
    However, this topic is the least interesting to me as I have worked on various projects related to prediction. \\
    In addition, I think there will be little value add to the academic world given the massive research done on
    prediction problems.
