	abstract = {We investigate several asset pricing models in an international setting. We use data on a large number of assets traded in the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and France. The models together with the hypothesis of capital market integration imply testable restrictions on multivariate regressions relating asset returns to various benchmark portfolios. We find that multifactor models tend to outperform single-index models in both domestic and international forms especially in their ability to explain seasonality in asset returns. We also find that the behavior of the models is affected by changes in the regulatory environment in international markets.},

	shorttitle = {The capital asset pricing model versus the three factor model},
	abstract = {The Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965) and Black (1972) Capital Asset Pricing Model ({CAPM}) postulates that the equilibrium rates of return on all risky assets are a linear function of their covariance with the market portfolio. Recent work by Fama and French (1996, 2006) introduce a Three Factor Model that questions the â€œreal world applicationâ€ of the {CAPM} Theorem and its ability to explain stock returns as well as value premium effects in the United States market. This paper provides an out-of-sample perspective to the work of Fama and French (1996, 2006). Multiple regression is used to compare the performance of the {CAPM}, a split sample {CAPM} and the Three Factor Model in explaining observed stock returns and value premium effects in the United Kingdom market. The methodology of Fama and French (2006) was used as the framework for this study. The findings show that the Three Factor Model holds for the United Kingdom Market and is superior to the {CAPM} and the split sample {CAPM} in explaining both stock returns and value premium effects. The real world application of the {CAPM} is therefore not supported by the United Kingdom data.},

	abstract = {An equilibrium Capital Asset Pricing Model ({CAPM}) of Treynor (1962), Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), Mossin (1966) asserts that stock returns are explained by their betas. Other study by Fama and French (1992) shows that the stock returns can be explained by not only their betas but also their sizes and growth. In this research-based article regressions and hypothesis testing are carried out. With a sample of 50 United Kingdom ({UK}) stocks, covering the period from 1980-2005, the hypothesis that stock returns are explained only by their betas is rejected. The results from this study also show that stock returns are not related to market returns and there is no linear relationship between actual stock returns and their respective betas. The hypotheses that size and growth have no power to explain the stock returns are also rejected in some cases and accepted in other cases.},

There are three stock-market factors: an overall market factor and factors related to firm size and book-to-market equity. There are two bond-market factors. related to maturity and default risks. Stock returns have shared variation due to the stock-market factors, and they are linked to bond returns through shared variation in the bond-market factors. Except for low-grade corporates. the bond-market factors capture the common variation in bond returns. Most important. the five factors seem to explain average returns on stocks and bonds.},

	abstract = {We perform a comparative analysis of machine learning methods for the canonical problem of empirical asset pricing: measuring asset risk premia.  We demonstrate large economic gains to investors using machine learning forecasts, in some cases doubling the performance of leading regression-based strategies from the literature.  We identify the best performing methods (trees and neural networks) and trace their predictive gains to allowance of nonlinear predictor interactions that are missed by other methods.  All methods agree on the same set of dominant predictive signals which includes variations on momentum, liquidity, and volatility.  Improved risk premium measurement through machine learning simplifies the investigation into economic mechanisms of asset pricing and highlights the value of machine learning in financial innovation.},

	abstract = {Only 23\% of all empirical studies published in the top journals in the field of Finance examine non-U.S. markets, a fraction that is well below measures that reflect their economic importance. This “home bias” fluctuates across years over the last two decades but with no discernible trend in any direction. There is also a “foreign bias” in which some non-U.S. countries are more frequently the subject of published papers than others. I am unable to explain much of either the home-bias or the foreign-bias puzzles in Finance research using a variety of supply factors (number of published authors affiliated with non-U.S. universities, number of Ph.D. students graduating from non-U.S. programs), demand factors (market returns, volatilities, portfolio flows), and other factors that have been shown to explain the home- and foreign-bias phenomenon in international portfolio holdings. I discuss the implications of these findings.},
