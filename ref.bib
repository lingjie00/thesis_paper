	abstract = {We investigate several asset pricing models in an international setting. We use data on a large number of assets traded in the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and France. The models together with the hypothesis of capital market integration imply testable restrictions on multivariate regressions relating asset returns to various benchmark portfolios. We find that multifactor models tend to outperform single-index models in both domestic and international forms especially in their ability to explain seasonality in asset returns. We also find that the behavior of the models is affected by changes in the regulatory environment in international markets.},

	shorttitle = {International arbitrage pricing theory},
	abstract = {The objective of this thesis was to analyse the empirical applicability of the Arbitrage Pricing Theory to international asset markets ({UK} stock market and {US} stock market) and to identify the set of economic variables which correspond most closely with the stock market factors obtained from the traditional factor analysis. Factor analysis and canonical correlation analysis were used as the principal tools for the empirical testing. Although factor analysis is frequently used, canonical correlation analysis is an new technique in this area and provides a method of linking factors extracted from the two sets of data. Various economic indicators were investigated as systematic influences on stock returns. It was shown that, based on the foundations of the {APT} and the characteristics of the factor scores from the factor analysis on the security returns and the economic indicators, canonical correlation analysis is an approximate technique to link the stock market and the economic forces. The results using the {UK} data imply that there is a good correspondence between factor scores generated by the factor analysis on the {UK} security returns and on the {UK} economic indicators. The results using the {US} data show that there is also a fair correspondence, but lower than that for the {UK} data, between factor scores generated by the factor analysis on the {US} security returns and on the {US} economic indicators. The {APT} was also investigated in an international setting by considering the {UK} data and the {US} data together. The results show that the canonical correlation analysis successfully links the stock returns and economic forces. The conclusion of these empirical findings is that security returns are influenced by a number of systematic economic forces. The validity and applicability of the {APT} were also empirically evaluated. The regression results show that the explanatory power of the {APT} model is fairly good. The overall results obtained here appear to suggest that the {APT} pricing relationship is supported by the testing methodology. In addition, the international correlation structure of financial markets movements between the {UK} economy and the {US} economy has been analysed. On balance, the evidence favours the {APT} and there is available evidence of inter-market linkage between the {UK} and the {US}. Individual sets of economic variables have been identified which correspond most closely with the {UK} and the {US} stock market factors by using the canonical correlation analysis. The results, at least partially, contribute to the understanding of security market pricing.},

	shorttitle = {The capital asset pricing model versus the three factor model},
	abstract = {The Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965) and Black (1972) Capital Asset Pricing Model ({CAPM}) postulates that the equilibrium rates of return on all risky assets are a linear function of their covariance with the market portfolio. Recent work by Fama and French (1996, 2006) introduce a Three Factor Model that questions the â€œreal world applicationâ€ of the {CAPM} Theorem and its ability to explain stock returns as well as value premium effects in the United States market. This paper provides an out-of-sample perspective to the work of Fama and French (1996, 2006). Multiple regression is used to compare the performance of the {CAPM}, a split sample {CAPM} and the Three Factor Model in explaining observed stock returns and value premium effects in the United Kingdom market. The methodology of Fama and French (2006) was used as the framework for this study. The findings show that the Three Factor Model holds for the United Kingdom Market and is superior to the {CAPM} and the split sample {CAPM} in explaining both stock returns and value premium effects. The real world application of the {CAPM} is therefore not supported by the United Kingdom data.},

Other study by Fama and French (1992) shows that the stock returns can be explained by not only their betas but also their sizes and growth. In this research-based article regressions and hypothesis testing are carried out. With a sample of 50 United Kingdom ({UK}) stocks, covering the period from 1980-2005, the hypothesis that stock returns are explained only by their betas is rejected. The results from this study also show that stock returns are not related to market returns and there is no linear relationship between actual stock returns and their respective betas. The hypotheses that size and growth have no power to explain the stock returns are also rejected in some cases and accepted in other cases.},

There are three stock-market factors: an overall market factor and factors related to firm size and book-to-market equity. There are two bond-market factors. related to maturity and default risks. Stock returns have shared variation due to the stock-market factors, and they are linked to bond returns through shared variation in the bond-market factors. Except for low-grade corporates. the bond-market factors capture the common variation in bond returns. Most important. the five factors seem to explain average returns on stocks and bonds.},

	abstract = {Transfer learning aims at improving the performance of target learners on target domains by transferring the knowledge contained in different but related source domains. In this way, the dependence on a large number of target-domain data can be reduced for constructing target learners. Due to the wide application prospects, transfer learning has become a popular and promising area in machine learning. Although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on transfer learning, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances in transfer learning. Due to the rapid expansion of the transfer learning area, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. This survey attempts to connect and systematize the existing transfer learning research studies, as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of transfer learning in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better understanding of the current research status and ideas. Unlike previous surveys, this survey article reviews more than 40 representative transfer learning approaches, especially homogeneous transfer learning approaches, from the perspectives of data and model. The applications of transfer learning are also briefly introduced. In order to show the performance of different transfer learning models, over 20 representative transfer learning models are used for experiments. The models are performed on three different data sets, that is, Amazon Reviews, Reuters-21578, and Office-31, and the experimental results demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate transfer learning models for different applications in practice.},

We demonstrate large economic gains to investors using machine learning forecasts, in some cases doubling the performance of leading regression-based strategies from the literature.  We identify the best performing methods (trees and neural networks) and trace their predictive gains to allowance of nonlinear predictor interactions that are missed by other methods.  All methods agree on the same set of dominant predictive signals which includes variations on momentum, liquidity, and volatility.  Improved risk premium measurement through machine learning simplifies the investigation into economic mechanisms of asset pricing and highlights the value of machine learning in financial innovation.},

There is also a “foreign bias” in which some non-U.S. countries are more frequently the subject of published papers than others. I am unable to explain much of either the home-bias or the foreign-bias puzzles in Finance research using a variety of supply factors (number of published authors affiliated with non-U.S. universities, number of Ph.D. students graduating from non-U.S. programs), demand factors (market returns, volatilities, portfolio flows), and other factors that have been shown to explain the home- and foreign-bias phenomenon in international portfolio holdings. I discuss the implications of these findings.},
