The literature on determining the appropriate form of the
SDF has a long history and perhaps is one of the largest
analysis in finance. The first asset-pricing model proposed by
@sharpe_capital_1964, @lintner_valuation_1965 and
@mossin_equilibrium_1966 in the 1960s was the
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
CAPM explains the variation in asset
returns with the assets' exposure to market risk.
The exposure is measured by a linear pricing kernel against
a wealth portfolio which includes all possible asset
classes. However, in reality, broad stock market index is
commonly used as a proxy for the wealth portfolio.
The resultant regression coefficient in this single-factor
model is coined as “beta”, and investors continued to use
“beta” as a measure of the systematic risk of assets.

@ross_arbitrage_1976 proposed the arbitrage pricing theory
(APT) and shown that if returns are generated by a linear
factor model, there is a SDF linear in factors that prices
the returns. However, the exact factors remained unknown.
@fama_common_1993 proposed their version of candidate
factors based on the APT and derived a three-factor model that
expands on the CAPM model by including size and value
factors.
@fama_common_1993 found that small market capitalisation
stocks and low-value stocks outperformed the market, and
including the size and value factors improves the
performance of the CAPM model.
The size factor is the difference in returns between the
smallest and largest stocks measured by market capitalisation.
On the other hand, the value factor is the difference in
returns between the cheapest and
most expensive stocks measured by price to book ratio.
@carhart_persistence_1997 built on the three-factor model
to include a momentum factor: the difference
in returns between the best and worst-performing stocks.
@fama_five-factor_2015 later expanded on the three-factor model to
include profitability and investment. The profitability
factor is the difference in returns between stocks with high
and low operating profitability, and the investment factor is
the difference in returns between high and low capital
investment stocks. The three, four, and five factor models
have been a benchmark for asset pricing models and
remain relevant today. 
In recent years, different research papers have attempted to
find new factors to improve the factor model performance.
The term "factor zoo" was used by @feng_taming_2020 to
describe the hundreds of factors proposed over the years in
the literature.
@feng_taming_2020 and @freyberger_dissecting_2017
investigated a wide range of such proposed factors and found
that only a handful are
statistically significant in explaining the asset returns.

The factor models mentioned earlier have explored different
factors while assuming a linear functional form for the SDF.
Recent literature attempt to estimate the SDF
with non-linear, non-parametric models such as decision tree-based methods and
neural network models. Non-parametric models do not require
a priori knowledge of the SDF’s functional form and
allow estimation of flexible non-linear functions.
Moreover, @freyberger_dissecting_2017 show that
non-linear relationships are essential in SDF estimation.
@gu_empirical_2020 compared different
machine learning models and show that tree and neural
network models marginally outperform linear models,
with the neural network model emerging as the best performing model,
measured by the out-of-sample $R^2$.

Traditional machine learning models do not 
consider economic theories during estimation.
@gu_autoencoder_2021 found that imposing
constraints based on economic theory can further improve
the neural network models.
Furthermore, @chen_deep_2021 imposed a no-arbitrage condition on neural
networks through a generative adversarial network (GAN)
model.

@goodfellow_generative_2014 first introduced GAN models for image recognition tasks,
and GAN models continue to be heavily used in image and video tasks,
as suggested by @s_generative_2021's recent survey.
GAN models differ from classical neural network models by including two
competing neural networks in a zero-sum game. In the context
of @chen_deep_2021 and this paper, one of the neural
networks will price assets through no-arbitrage condition while the
other neural network will attempt to find factors and
mispriced assets to increase pricing error.
This paper will explain the GAN model in detail in the methodology section.

Consumption-based asset pricing is an alternative approach
that derives SDF directly from a utility function. However, 
@campbell_explaining_2000 show that the consumption-based model
cannot account for the time-varying
nature of SDF, resulting in poor performance compared to
the factor models. Therefore, this paper focuses on
factor models.

Current literature estimates SDF solely based on the
firm characteristics data. However, 
@pelger_interpretable_2020 found that
including macroeconomic data can further improve the
performance of machine learning models, which is also
evident in @chen_deep_2021's results.
@chen_deep_2021 included a recurrent neural network with
long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture in the GAN model
to capture the time series dynamics of the macroeconomic data.
@hochreiter_long_1997 first proposed the LSTM architecture, and a recent
review on the applications of LSTM by @houdt_review_2020
found that LSTM is still commonly used in sequence data to
capture dynamics in data, such as language-related tasks.
This paper will also explain the different LSTM components
in the methodology section.

The main contribution of this paper is in examining the
external validity of @chen_deep_2021's model using the
United Kingdom (U.K.) London Stock Exchange (LSE) data.
@karolyi_home_2012 found that most
empirical papers consider the data-rich United States, with
only around 20% of the papers in top finance journals
investigating countries outside the United States (U.S.).
Likewise, @chen_deep_2021 model was also
trained based on the U.S. data.
Therefore, this paper explores the model performance in a
different context, such as the U.K. market.
There are several works of literature done on LSE data,
but none answers the question this paper seeks to address.
@bhatnagar_capital_2012 and 
@korajczyk_empirical_1989 focus only on
linear factor models, while @tobek_does_2018
forecast asset prices without considering economic theories.
Therefore, one of the critical contributions of this paper
is to provide insights into the potential benefits advanced
models can bring to the empirical asset pricing of UK
securities.
