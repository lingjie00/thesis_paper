<!-- # Empirical findings -->

The [Data](#data) section describes two types of
datasets: *factor* and *fundamental* data.
The *factor data* training contains more assets but lesser
characteristic data, while *fundamental data* training
contains more characteristic data with lesser assets.
Therefore, readers should consider the difference across the
datasets used when interpreting the results.
Generally, neural network models require a large dataset for
training. However, as @noauthor_google_2019 recommended in their
developer website, there is no common consensus among
literature and the required size of dataset may be
context-dependent.
