Since this paper attempts to empirically validate
@chen_deep_2019's GAN model, it is worth noting that
@chen_deep_2019 data includes 50 years of historical data
with over 10,000 stocks. Although the number of
macroeconomic data available is comparable (178 in
@chen_deep_2019's paper and 112 in this paper), the number
of firm characteristics data available in this paper is
limited. As @karras_training_2020 and
@zhao_differentiable_2020 and other recent literature pointed out, 
training GAN models with little data generally
leading to discriminator (in this paper the discriminator
refers to the neural network estimating SDF function)
over-fitting. However, proposed solutions in current
literature is only applicable to image
data. This paper takes a caution against rejecting
@chen_deep_2019's paper due to the much smaller data
available.
