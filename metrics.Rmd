This paper evaluates the performance of the GAN model against the
Fama French model based on the mispricing error and Sharpe
ratio.

## Mispricing error with beta representation

Expected return beta representation refers to the one-factor model
implied by the no-arbitrage condition. We first explain the
exposure to systematic risk $\beta_{t, i}$ formulation
before interpreting the variable of interest: mispricing
error $\alpha_i$.
As explained in [no-arbitrage asset pricing loss function
chapter](#loss_function), no-arbitrage condition implies
$E_t[M_{t+1}R^e_{t+1, i}] = 0$. As shown in the equation
below, using the covariance formula
$Cov(X, Y) = E(XY)-E(X)E(Y)$ we have 
$E_t[M_{t+1}R^e_{t+1, i}] = \beta_{t, i}\lambda_t$
where $\lambda_t$ is the market price of risk that is
independent of asset $i$ and $\beta_{t, i}$ is the quantity
of risk.

\begin{align*}
E_t[M_{t+1}R^e_{t+1, i}] = 0 &= Cov_t[M_{t+1}R^e_{t+1, i}] +
E_t[M_{t+1}]E_t[R^e_{t+1, i}]\\
\Rightarrow E_t[R^e_{t+1, i}] &= 
\left(-\frac{Cov_t[M_{t+1}, R^e_{t+1,
i}]}{Var_t[M_{t+1}]}\right)
\cdot
\frac{Var_t[M_{t+1}]}{E_t[M_{t+1}]}
= \beta_{t, i} \cdot \lambda_t
\end{align*}

We consider the general case where the stochastic discount
factor (SDF) $M_{t+1}$ is an affine transformation of the
tangency portfolio $F_{t+1}$,
and we have $M_{t+1} = a - b F_{t+1}$.
We define the tangency portfolio in terms of the 
excess return compared to the risk-free rate $F_{t+1} :=
\bold{\omega}_t^T R^e_{t+1, F}$ with the SDF weight
$\bold{\omega}_t$. Furthermore, since
$E[M_{t+1}R^f_{t+1}] = 1 \Rightarrow R^f_{t+1} = 1/E[M_{t+1}]$.
We have:
\begin{align*}
    E_t[R^e_{t+1, i}] &= -Cov_t[a - b F_{t+1},
    R^e_{t+1, i}]R^f_{t+1}
    = b Cov_t[F_{t+1}, R^e_{t+1, i}] R^f_{t+1}
\end{align*}

When the asset $i$ is the tangency portfolio $F_{t+1}$ itself,
we have
\begin{align*}
    E_t[F_{t+1}] = b Cov_t[F_{t+1}, F_{t+1}]
    R^f_{t+1}
    \Rightarrow b = \frac{E_t[F_{t+1}]}
    {Var_t[F_{t+1}] R^f_{t+1}}
\end{align*}

Substituting the value of $b$ we have
\begin{align*}
    E_t[R^e_{t+1, i}] &= 
    \left(\frac{E_t[F_{t+1}]}
    {Var_t[F_{t+1}] R^f_{t+1}}\right)
    \cdot Cov_t[F_{t+1}, R^e_{t+1, i}] R^f_{t+1}\\
    &= \frac{Cov_t[ F_{t+1}, R^e_{t+1, i} ]}
    {Var_t[F_{t+1}]} E_t[F_{t+1}]
    = \beta_{t, i}E_t[F_{t+1}]
\end{align*}

Therefore, the no-arbitrage condition resulted in a
one-factor model with $\alpha_i = 0, E_t[\epsilon_{t+1,
i}]=0$ and $Cov_t[F_{t+1}, \epsilon_{t+1, i}] =0$. We
perform t-test with $H_0: \alpha_i = 0, H_1: \alpha_i \neq
0$ to determine if the tangency portfolio $F_{t+1}$ found by
different models align with the no-arbitrage condition.
As mispricing error $\alpha_i$ is asset dependent, we
provide summary statistics on the individual asset
$\alpha_i$ and the risk $\beta_{t, i}$ sorted decile portfolio
statistics.

$$
R^e_{t+1, i} = \alpha_i + \beta_{t, i} F_{t+1} +
\epsilon_{t+1, i}
$$

## Sharpe ratio

William F. Sharpe proposed the Sharpe ratio in 1966 to evaluate
the performance of risk-adjusted assets relative to a
risk-free asset [@sharpe_mutual_1966]. A Sharpe ratio ($S$)
for an asset $i$ is defined as the asset's historical excess
return $E_t(R^e_{i})$ weighted by the risk of the asset,
where the standard deviation of the excess return $\sigma_i$
approximates the risk of an asset. The excess return is the
difference between the asset's return and the risk-free
return $E_t(R^e_{i}) = E_t(R_{i} - R^f)$. Sharpe ratio
measures the reward investors get when investing in the
asset while considering the risk of the
assets. Therefore, a higher Sharpe ratio implies the asset
is better, and tangency portfolio $F_{t+1}$ that lies
on the mean-variance frontier will have the highest Sharpe
ratio possible. 
We compare the Sharpe ratio of the tangency portfolio by
both GAN and Fama French models to decide on the model with
better performance.

$$
S(R_i) = \frac{E_t[R_i - R^f]}{\sigma_i}
$$
