## Generative adversarial network (GAN) model

Generative adversarial network (GAN) model is first proposed
by Goodfellow to xxxx. It is currently commonly used in
deep fake and other image, video related tasks. The
fundamental idea of GAN network is to train two competing
network linked through a single loss function.

There are two functions we are interested in finding:
$\omega_t=\omega(I_t, I_{t, i})$ and 
$\beta_{t, i}=\beta(I_t, I_{t, i})$

These two functions are sufficient for:

```{=latex}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explain cross-section of individual stock return $R^e_{t+1, i}$
    \item Construct conditional mean-variance efficient tagency portfolio $f_{t+1}(\omega_t)$
    \item Decompose stock returns into their predictable systematic componenet $\beta_{t, i}, f_{t+1}$ and their non-systematic unpredictable
        component $\epsilon_{t+1, i}$
\end{enumerate}
```

We will be using GAN (Generative adversarial network) methods to deduce $\omega_t$, which will construct $f_{t+1}$ and 
later will be used to deduce $\beta_{t, i}$.

GAN model requires 'Generator' and 'Discriminator'.

A generator predict the outcome we are interested in (in our
case, the function $\omega_t$) while a discriminator
produces fake data that meant to confuse the generator (a
pricing error function $g$ which we will define later). 

A loss function links the generator and discriminator, and
training will continue until neither generator nor
discriminator can improve their performance further.
