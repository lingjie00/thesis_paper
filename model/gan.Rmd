## GAN model {#gan_model}

GAN model consists of two competing neural networks called
discriminator and generator. The discriminator in this paper
will estimate the SDF weight function $\omega(I_t, I_{t,
i})$, and the generator will estimate the factor function
$g(I_t, I_{t, i})$. Both models use an
LSTM network to extract macroeconomic data and a
feed-forward network to extract firm characteristic data.
The [GAN architecture](#gan_structure) section
explains the model structure in-depth.

$$
\text{Discriminator: } \omega(I_t, I_{t, i})
\text{, Generator:} g(I_t, I_{t, i})
$$

Therefore, the GAN training procedure can be viewed as a
zero-sum game where the discriminator minimises the
pricing loss. In contrast, the generator tries to maximise the
pricing loss. Note that the functions estimated by
discriminator and generator are both time and asset
independent. Given a data size $N$, we summarise the GAN training as the following
min-max optimisation problem with the pricing loss function
motivated by the no-arbitrage condition.

\begin{align*}
    \min_{\omega} \max_{g} L(\omega, g|I_t, I_{t, i}) &=
    \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left\{
    E \left[ \left( 1 - \sum_{j=1}^N \omega(I_t, I_{t, j})
    R^e_{t+1, j} \right) R^e_{t+1, j}g(I_t, I_{t, i})
    \right] \right\}^2
\end{align*}
