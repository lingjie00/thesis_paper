**Generator: $\omega(I_t, I_{t, i})$**

Given that $f_{t+1}=\omega_t^T R^e_{t+1}$, we need $\omega_t$ and $R^e_{t+1}$

$R^e_{t+1}$ can be calculated with $R_{t+1} - R^f_{t+1}$ using price data.

Only estimation required will be $\omega(I_t, I_{t, i})$.

**Discriminator: $g(I_t, I_{t, i})$**

Under no arbitrage model, there exist a $m_{t+1}$ such that $E(m_{t+1}R^e_{t+1})=0$.

In a more general case, we can always find a uncondtional expectation where 

\begin{align*}
    E(m_{t+1}R^e_{t+1, i}g(I_t, I_{t, i}))=0
\end{align*}

$g$ represents factors unexplained by the no-arbitrage model, or a pricing error.

We will use $g$ as our discriminator.
