## Long short-term memory network model

Recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of neural network that considers the past data in future prediction.

Long Term Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a subclass of RNN that considers dynamic past data in future prediciton.

LSTM is an improvement over vanilla RNN.
In a vanilla RNN, an unique weight is given to each of the lagged data. 
The number of lagged data will be pre-determined and could not scale well with higher lags.

LSTM solves the problem by introducing forget gate, input gate and output gate.
Simplify saying, LSTM endogenously handle the number of lags that will be useful in the prediction.

Since we suspect past macro economic feature will affect our estimation and we are uncertain how many lag terms
to include, we use RNN with LSTM to let the model decide the number lag terms.
