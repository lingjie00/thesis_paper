## No arbitrage asset pricing model 

The no-arbitrage asset pricing model assumes a stochastic
discount factor (SDF) $M_t$ such that excess return does not
exist. We denote $R_{t, i}$ as the asset $i$'s return in
time $t$ and $R^f_t$ as the return of a risk free asset.
Therefore, the excess return is defined as $R^e_{t, i} =
R_{t, i} - R^f_{t, i}$. The no-arbitrage asset pricing model
can be express as the following equation. Note that SDF is
asset independent and time varying.

$$
E_t[M_{t+1} R^e_{t+1, i}] = 0
$$

We can also express SDF as an affine transformation of
tangency portfolio, which we denote the tangency portfolio as
$F_t := \bold{\omega_t}^T R^e_{t+1}$, where
$\bold{\omega_t}$ is the SDF weights.
Using the covariance formula
$E(XY)=E(X)E(Y) + Cov(X, Y)$ and correlation formula 
$E(XY) = E(X)E(Y)+\rho(X, Y)\sigma(X)\sigma(Y)$,
we have $E(M_{t+1})E(R^e_{t+1,
i}) = -\rho(M_{t+1}, R^e_{t+1,
i})\sigma(M_{t+1})\sigma(R^e_{t+1})$. Since
$\rho(\cdot)\in(0, 1)$, we can express the bounds of the
excess return as a function of the risk of the asset,
forming the mean-variance frontier, illustrated in
figure \@ref(fig:mvf).

$$
|E(R^e_{t+1, i})| \leq \left(\frac{\sigma_t(M_{t+1})}
{E_t(M_{t+1})}\right)\sigma_t(R^e_{t+1})
$$

Now, since tangency portfolio occur at the mean-variance
frontier when $\rho(M_{t+1}, F_{t+1})=-1$, this means
tangency portfolio is perfectly correlated to SDF $M_{t+1}$
and we can express the SDF as a linear function of
tangency portfolio, $M_{t+1} = a - b F_{t+1}$. Since any
mean-variance efficient return carries all the pricing
information, we consider one of the possible $(a, b) = (1,
1)$.

$$
M_{t+1} = 1 - F_{t+1} = 1 - \bold{\omega_t}^T R^e_{t+1, F}
$$

Therefore, the no-arbitrage states there exists a SDF
$M_{t+1}$ which is a linear function of the tangency
portfolio $F_{t+1}$ such that for any asset $i$, we have the
following relationship which we will use to construct our
loss function to train GAN model.

$$
E\left[\left(1-\bold{\omega}_t^T R^e_{t+1,
F}\right)R^e_{t+1, i}\right] = 0
$$
