## No-arbitrage asset-pricing model {#no_arbitrage}

The no-arbitrage asset pricing model assumes the existence
of an asset independent, time-dependent pricing kernel, also known as a stochastic
discount factor (SDF) $M_t$, such that there is no excess
return in expectation.
Let $R_{t+1, i}$ denote the asset $i$'s return in
time $t+1$ and $R^f_{t+1}$ as the return of a risk-free asset.
The excess return is then defined as $R^e_{t+1, i} :=
R_{t+1, i} - R^f_{t+1}$. Summarising the no-arbitrage
condition, we have the equation
$$
E_t[M_{t+1} R^e_{t+1, i}] = 0.
$$

SDF can be expressed as an affine transformation of a
mean-variance efficient tangency portfolio.
The mean-variance efficient frontier refers to the maximum
possible balance between the mean excess returns and risk
factor, measured by the variance of the
excess returns. A portfolio that maximises mean-variance
efficiency is considered as a tangency portfolio. 
Let $\mathbf{\omega}_t$ denote the SDF weights used to
construct the tangency portfolio based on all the assets in
the market, and
$F_{t+1} := \mathbf{\omega}_t^T R^e_{t+1}$ denote the tangency
portfolio.
Using the covariance formula
$E(XY)=E(X)E(Y) + Cov(X, Y)$ and correlation formula 
$E(XY) = E(X)E(Y)+\rho(X, Y)\sigma(X)\sigma(Y)$,
we have $E(M_{t+1})E(R^e_{t+1,
i}) = -\rho(M_{t+1}, R^e_{t+1,
i})\sigma(M_{t+1})\sigma(R^e_{t+1})$. Since
$\rho(\cdot)\in(0, 1)$, we can express the bounds of the
excess return as a function of the risk of the asset,
forming the mean-variance frontier, illustrated in
figure \@ref(fig:mvf)

$$
|E_t(R^e_{t+1, i})| \leq \left(\frac{\sigma_t(M_{t+1})}
{E_t(M_{t+1})}\right)\sigma_t(R^e_{t+1}).
$$

Since the tangency portfolio occurs at the mean-variance
frontier where $\rho(M_{t+1}, F_{t+1})=-1$,
it is perfectly correlated to the SDF
which is given by an affine transformation of the SDF
($M_{t+1} = a - b F_{t+1}$). Since any
mean-variance efficient return carries all the pricing
information, without loss of generality,
we consider one of the possible $(a, b) = (1,
1)$

$$
M_{t+1} = 1 - F_{t+1} = 1 - \mathbf{\omega}_t^T R^e_{t+1}.
$$

Therefore, the no-arbitrage condition reduces the
asset-pricing problem into estimating an SDF weight function
$\omega$ such that the following equation holds. We will
use this relationship to construct our loss function that
trains the GAN model

$$
E\left[\left(1-\mathbf{\omega}_t^T R^e_{t+1}\right)R^e_{t+1, i}\right] = 0.
$$


## Pricing loss function {#loss_function}

The no-arbitrage condition reduces the asset pricing problem
into estimating the SDF weight function $\omega$.
This paper assumes $\omega$ is a function of
macroeconomic data $I_t$ and firm characteristic
data $I_{t, i}$.
However, suppose the no-arbitrage condition
alone is insufficient to explain the differences in asset
prices. In that case, we can define a function $g(I_t, I_{t, i})$
that selects firm characteristic and assets and output some factor
unexplained by the no-arbitrage
to price the assets. The relationship between $\omega(I_t,
I_{t, i})$ and $g(I_t, I_{t, i})$ can be described by the
following equation. We define this as our pricing loss
function. The pricing loss function can be viewed as a
competition between the no-arbitrage condition and an
alternative theory that explains the variation in
asset excess returns, which is the key in building the
GAN model proposed by @chen_deep_2021

$$
E\left[\left(1-\omega(I_t, I_{t, i})^T R^e_{t+1}\right)R^e_{t+1, i}
g(I_t, I_{t, i})
\right] = 0.
